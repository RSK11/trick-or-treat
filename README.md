# Trick or Treat
### April 14, 2017


Trick or Treat was the first game I made for my Interactive Entertainment class. It is a text based adventure game centered around trick or treating on Halloween night with your best friend Jeffery. A detailed description of the technical accomplishments in this project can be found in the [technical report](tech_report.txt). The commands needed for a full playthrough can be found in [playthrough.txt](playthrough.txt).


The source for the game was written with Inform 7 and can be found at [Trick or Treat.inform/Source/story.ni](Trick or Treat.inform/Source/story.ni)
